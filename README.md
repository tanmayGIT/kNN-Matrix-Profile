The interest of kNN search over 1NN search is shown in Fig. 5 and 6 of the article. To generate these plot, run the following code and follow the instructions mentioned inside these code :
```matlab
-- Journal_Exp_1.m
-- Journal_Exp_2.m
```

The use case, mentioned in Fig. 8 can be obtained by running the code :
```matlab
-- outliers_plot.m
```
Fig. 10 : The variation of computational time with the increasing number of kNN similarity search. The computational time analysis is shown for three different proposed approaches i.e. max based (refer to Section 4.2.2 ), sort based (refer to Section 4.2.1) and heap-max based (refer to Section 4.2.3 ) for kNN similarity search.
